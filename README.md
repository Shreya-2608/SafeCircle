# 🛡️ SafeCircle

**SafeCircle** is a women's safety and awareness website built to provide quick access to help, support, and empowerment. With features like 24/7 affirmations, an SOS alert system, safety shelter maps, and a hidden emergency calculator, SafeCircle is designed for real-time action and discretion.

## 🌟 Features

- 💬 **Daily Affirmations**: Click the "Inspire Me" button to get empowering affirmations anytime.
- 🗺️ **Safety Shelter Map**: Shows verified safety spots like police stations and shelters.
- 🆘 **SOS Alert**: Instantly send an SOS message with important details.
- 🧮 **Hidden SOS Calculator**: Looks and works like a regular calculator — but if you’re in trouble, entering **100** sends a secret SOS while showing an error message to avoid suspicion.

## 🚀 How to Use
